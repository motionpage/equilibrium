# Equilibrium Theme

I have been using this tweaked theme for quite a while, so I've decided to push it out.
This theme was tweaked in the way, so you could keep working for countless hours without eye strain. It works great in both dark rooms or rooms full of sunshine. Retinas and TN panels, you count it.
